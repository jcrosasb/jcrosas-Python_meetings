    "1. Every object in Python is polymorphic, except `object`\n",
    "2. Compile-time polymorphism, which I called method overloading, not really somehting Python is intended to do. You may do it, but is bad practice. ***Method overloading*** refers to having two methods with the same name but different signature\n",
    "3. ***Method overriding*** means having two methods with same signature but different implementation.\n",
    "4. Refering to the class from yesterday, a hybird car is a polymorphic object because a hybrid car is a type of car, a car is a type of vehicle, and so on...(a chain of inheritance). The method `fuel()` is run-time polymorphic because it ahs the same signature across different classes but the datisl of implementation depend on the specifi object.\n"
