    "##### ENCAPSULATION\n",
    "It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behavior) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation provides several benefits in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Hiding: Encapsulation allows the internal state of an object to be hidden from the outside world. By making attributes private or protected, access to the object's data is restricted to only the methods of the class, preventing direct manipulation of the data by external code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modularity: Encapsulation promotes modularity by grouping related data and methods together within a class. This makes it easier to manage and understand the behavior of the class, as all relevant components are contained within a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Abstraction: Encapsulation facilitates abstraction by exposing only the essential attributes and methods of an object while hiding the implementation details. This allows objects to interact with each other through well-defined interfaces, without exposing the internal workings of their data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***NOTE:*** Python does not have built-in access control keywords like private, protected, and public to explicitly restrict access to class members (attributes and methods). Instead, Python uses naming conventions to indicate privacy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attributes or methods starting with a single underscore (_) are considered protected and should be treated as internal to the class or its subclasses.\n",
    "* Attributes or methods starting with a double underscore (__) are considered private and undergo name mangling, making them harder to access from outside the class."

    "##### INHERITANCE\n",
    "Allows a new class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or parent class). The subclass can then extend or override the functionality of the superclass, promoting code reuse and modularity.\n",
    "\n",

    "##### POLYMORPHISM\n",
    "Allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling code to be written in a more generic and flexible way. Polymorphism allows methods to behave differently based on the object they are called on, providing a mechanism for dynamic dispatch and runtime method resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism):** also known as method overloading. Two or more methods have the same name but different numbers of parameters or different types of parameters, or both. These methods are called overloaded methods and this is called method overloading. The problem with method overloading in Python is that we may overload the methods but can only use the latest defined method. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism):** also known as method overriding, run-time polymorphism occurs when a method in a subclass overrides a method with the same signature (name and parameters) in its superclass. The decision about which method to call is made at runtime based on the type of the object. Run-time polymorphism allows for more flexible and dynamic behavior, as the method to be executed is determined dynamically during program execution."
