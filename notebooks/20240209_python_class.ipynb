    "##### NOTE ON THE NAMING OF THE ENVIRONMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "Naming a virtual environment directory as ***.venv*** is a common convention in Python projects. Here's why it's commonly used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hidden Directory: Directories and files in Unix-based systems (such as Linux and macOS) that start with a dot (.) are treated as hidden directories or files by default. This means they are not  displayed when listing directory contents with commands like ls unless the -a flag is used. Naming the virtual environment directory as .venv makes it hidden by default, keeping the project directory clean and reducing clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Convention: Using .venv as the name for the virtual environment directory has become a widely recognized convention in the Python community. Many developers are familiar with this convention, making it easy to understand and follow in Python projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Clarity: The .venv name clearly indicates that the directory contains a virtual environment. This can be helpful when navigating the project directory structure, especially in projects with multiple virtual environments or complex setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Consistency: Consistency in naming conventions across different projects and environments can make it easier for developers to switch between projects and understand the structure of unfamiliar     projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "While using .venv is a common convention, you are free to choose any name for your virtual environment directory. However, following established conventions can make your project more accessible to other developers and contribute to a more consistent and organized project structure."
